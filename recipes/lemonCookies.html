    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ⅓ cup almond flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons coconut flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup xylotol (can go up to ⅓ cup for a sweeter flavor)</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Liquid Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup lemon juice, fresh</li>
      <li>¼ cup melted coconut oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest optional</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup Sugar-free powdered sweetener</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest (optional, to decorate)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Line a cookie tray with parchment paper.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients: almond flour,
        coconut flour, sugar-free crystal sweetener, and baking soda.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and add melted coconut
        oil, lemon juice, lemon extract, and lemon zest. Combine until it forms
        a sticky, soft cookie dough. The batter should be soft, buttery, and not
        dry. If dry, adjust by adding 1-2 teaspoons of water. If too wet, add an
        extra teaspoon of coconut flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate the dough for 10 minutes, wrapped in a piece of plastic wrap
        or in the mixing bowl covered with a silicone lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the dough from the fridge and shape 8 even cookie dough balls.
        You can weigh the dough if you want precision and divide it into 8
        portions of the same weight.
      </li>
      <li>Roll each ball in your hands to shape smooth cookie dough balls.</li>
      <li>
        Place each ball on the cookie tray, leaving a thumb-size space between
        each ball. The cookies won't expand in the oven, so you don't have to
        leave a big space between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the balls slightly with the palm of your hand to flatten cookies.
        Don't flatten too much, or the sides will form cracks, and they won't be
        as soft and moist. The thicker, the moister!
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 12-15 minutes or until golden on the sides. The middle will
        stay slightly soft, and that is the texture you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the cookie tray from the oven and cool down on the tray for 20
        minutes before transferring it to the rack to cool down to room
        temperature. Don't touch the cookies during the first 20 minutes. They
        are soft and need time to firm up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Glaze the cookies:
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a small mixing bowl, combine the sugar-free powdered sweetener,
            coconut oil, and lemon juice. Play with the texture, adding more
            sweetener, 1 teaspoon at a time for thicker glazing, or more lemon
            juice for thinner glazing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drizzle the glazing onto the cold cookies. Don't decorate warm or
            lukewarm cookies or the glazing will melt and be absorbed by the
            cookie dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            For lovely, white glazing, place the cookies 2 minutes in the
            freezer just after adding the glazing. This step sets the glazing
            fast and makes beautiful cookie decorations.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle lemon zest on top if desired.</li>
      <li>
        Store the lemon cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 days in the
        pantry or in the fridge if you prefer your cookies firm.
      </li>
    </ol>
