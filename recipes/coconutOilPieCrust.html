    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups unbleached all purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
      <li>2/3 cup coconut oil (scoopable, not liquid)</li>
      <li>3-6 Tbsp ice cold water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        See notes about coconut oil to ensure it's the right texture before
        starting!
      </li>
      <li>Add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
      <li>
        Next add coconut oil in spoonfuls (see photo) and use a pastry cutter
        (or fork) to cut the two together, until it resembles wet sand - about
        30-45 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ice cold water 1 Tbsp at a time and use a wooden spoon to gently
        mix. Add only as much water as needed to help it come together and form
        a dough - about 3-4 Tbsp (amount as original recipe is written // adjust
        if altering batch size).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use your hands to gently knead/form the dough in the bowl and gather any
        loose scraps. Then transfer directly to a well-floured surface and form
        into a disc with your hands.
      </li>
      <li>
        NOTE: If using the crust for 2 pies (or 1 bottom crust and 1 top crust),
        divide the dough in half to roll out separately (amount as original
        recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Otherwise, keep it
        in one piece.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lightly flour the top of the dough, as well as a rolling pin, and gently
        roll into a circle the shape of your pie pan, about 1/8-inch thick. Add
        more flour as needed to prevent sticking. It’s fairly forgiving, so if
        it cracks, just patch it up with slightly wet fingers and reform.
      </li>
      <li>
        NOTE: To make mini pies in a muffin tin, roll your dough about 1/4-inch
        thick (see photo), adding more flour if the crust sticks. Then use a
        large, round cookie cutter (~3 1/4-inch in diameter) to cut out as many
        circles as the dough will allow - you’re aiming for 12 (amount as
        original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and you
        should have more than enough dough. Dust a large wooden cutting board
        (or other surface) with flour, and use a spatula to scoop on one circle
        at a time. Lightly flour top of circle, then use your rolling pin to
        gently roll it out slightly larger and thinner - about 1.5 times its
        starting size. Be careful not to get it too thin or it will be difficult
        to work with. Use your spatula to lift the crust, then use your hands to
        drape the crust into your muffin tin, allowing the edges to fold and
        curl over itself to accommodate its shape (see photo). Use your hands to
        carefully form the crust into the tins, being careful not to stretch the
        dough, but rather fold and push it down to meet the tin’s shape. Repeat
        until all tins have been filled and most of the crust is used - reserve
        any leftover for future pies or other baked goods.
      </li>
      <li>
        If using a standard 9-inch (or similar size) pie crust, simply use the
        rolling pin to roll up crust and drape it over the pan. Form the edges
        simply (avoiding too tall of edges or fancy designs as the coconut oil
        doesn't hold it as well as butter) and add filling of choice (such as
        apple or pumpkin). Roll out remaining crust, drape over the top of pie,
        and seal (optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake pie(s) at 350 degrees F - 400 degrees F for desired length of time
        (will vary depending on filling - 30 minutes to 1 hour or more). If
        browning too quickly, tent the edges with foil to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        To save uncooked dough for future use, wrap in plastic wrap and set in
        the refrigerator for 2 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 weeks. Thaw
        before using.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure your coconut oil is scoopable (in the state it typically is
        when you buy it at the store), not liquid. If it's too liquidy and
        pourable, this will negatively affect the crust. To fix, set jar in
        refrigerator to firm up for 30 minutes, then stir and let rest another
        30 minutes at room temperature. The oil should be consistently solid,
        not partially solid and partially liquid. Repeat this process (of
        chilling, stirring, resting), until the right texture is achieved (see
        photo of spoon with oil). This is key to ensuring the crust texture is
        just right and dough is easy to work with. (For best and most consistent
        results, be sure to store your coconut oil in a cool, dark place to keep
        it at the right texture/consistency.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Recipe (as originally written) yields enough for one 9-inch pie + enough
        crust for topping/sealing, OR enough for 12-14 mini pies (made in muffin
        tins).
